Benedict Andrews Talks About His Work
Famous Australian director Benedict Andrews talked to the BBC about his current play and his first film. He talked about the actors in both who have been so brave. The play is called Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and the name of the film is Una. 
Benedict Andrews is an Australian theatre and film director, based in Reykjavík. Over the past decade, Andrews has built up his body of work for theatres in both Australia and Europe. He is known for his versions of works by Shakespeare, Anton Chekhov, Jean Genet, and Tennessee Williams, as well as his stagings of contemporary writers such as David Harrower, Martin Crimp, Marius von Mayenburg, Caryl Churchill and Sarah Kane. His first feature film Una which was an adaption of Blackbird by David Harrower, was released in 2016. Both the movie and the play are intense and leave little to imagination. Both are full of emotional rawness with a lot of exposing. He called the performance truly special, brave and unguarded. He said that he has been blessed to work with actors who were always hungry for a great material. 
When someone is wholeheartedly dedicated towards what they do, it shows in their work. His plays and movie have shown the world that he is a great director. He is known for working on complex themes and he has been acclaimed for that. We hope that he succeeds in his endeavours
