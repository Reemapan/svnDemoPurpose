United Nations Security Council reveals that North Korea has been supplying banned materials  to Syrian government
North Korea Crosses All Limits 
In the latest report of United Nations Security Council, it has been revealed that North Korea has been supplying materials - that are used for making chemical weapons - to the Syrian government. It is an alarming report on North Korea as well as the government of Syria.       
Syria has been going through civil war since 2011 and very recently on 26th Feb, a chlorine gas attack was reported in Eastern Ghouta region at Syrian capital Damascus. Although a terrorist group ISIS has been completely pushed out from Syria, there are many internal rebels left, like in Eastern Ghouta. As per the report, officials  North Korea have been supplying acid-resistant tiles, valves, and thermometers required for making chemical weapons, like Chlorine gas. North Korean experts are also visiting Syria regularly and many deals have been signed between the nations facilitating the trading of banned weapons (as declared by UN for maintaining peace in the world). The outbreak of Civil War in Syria has seen many cases of use of chemical weapons. While allegations have been made by UN, USA, and many other western countries, Syria has denied it. Meanwhile, North Korea faced many strict sanctions by the same to halt its anti-peace activities (like nuclear missile tests) by bringing its economy to knees. The above findings by UNSC can be concluded that for North Korea, it is nothing more than a source of income (generated 200 million dollars to date). And for Syria, it acts as a means to exercise control over its occupied territory by rebels. Assad already has a support of Russia and Iran, and so North Korea’s help is going to make the situation worse for Syrian rebels or maybe innocent people. 
It was the intervention of Russia and Iran (providing support to Assad) and the USA and Saudi Arabia (providing support to rebels) that a peaceful protest by pro-democracy Syrian well-wishers was caught in the flames, banned weapons, and destruction. While it can be said that stricter sanctions by the USA (on North Korea) paved a way for alternative sources of income, it seems that N. Korea found a right place where it can battle against the USA too. Amidst all, the people of Syria are suffering badly with all the human rights violated; death toll in 7 years has reached 340,000!

The Israeli government may stop its operations of bringing Ethiopian Jews back to Israel
Jews in Ethiopia Look Forward To Israel 
Jews of Ethiopia are in a state of nowhere. Their hope of being united with their family members in Israel has suffered a setback. The Israeli government may stop its operations of bringing them back to Israel as reflected in the upcoming proposed budget: funds will be eliminated for such operations. Ethiopian Jews warned to go on a hunger strike on 28th Feb 2018 at Addis Ababa, Ethiopia if Israel (a Jewish country) fails to take them back.       
In the year 1991, an operation was carried ours by Israel was known as Solomon operation that airlifted more than 14,500 Ethiopian Jews. It was because at that times, Ethiopia was going through a Civil War and so for well being of Ethiopian Jews, Israeli government conducted Operation Solomon in assistance of USA. However, many were left and they are now around 8000 in total. In 2015, it was promised that they would bring back more Ethiopian Jews but the efforts were stopped without any reason. And now with the latest Budget to finalised in coming weeks, it might be forever. So, Jews stranded in Ethiopia (the second most populous country on the African continent) are now demanding Israel to deliver on its promise. There are around 800 families living in severe poverty and hunger. This is because Jews in Ethiopia are treated as strangers (locally referred as Falashas) and are not given rights like any other Ethiopian citizen. The problem with them, as per an expert, is that some of their ancestors were forcefully converted to Christianity which makes their Jewish identity somewhat not to be accepted. However, the community strictly follows Jewish lifestyle. 
Did you that it is widely accepted that ancestors of modern humans i.e. Homo sapiens emerged first at the land of Ethiopia and then spread over the whole world and made religions and families? It is an irony that now a minority of the people living here are nowhere to go... departed from their families.

Cold Wave hits Northern Europe
Beast from the East arrives in Europe 
People in Northern Europe couldn’t have asked for a worse bit may have predicted... At least who are aware of consequences of global warming. The temperature in countries like Warsaw and Oslo has gone below eight degrees and people are freezing in these cold-affected areas. Scientists believe that this is the direct result of manmade Global Warming.        
As per a Climate Scientist, a wave of warm air at the height of 30,000 feet above the North Pole has caused the cold air to travel global south. Because of this, certain regions in Northern Europe will face extreme cold weather... temperatures going 10-20 degree Celsius below normal winter temperatures. This has been nicknamed as &quot;Beast from the East&quot; by media. The wind will be extremely cold and strong and thus, cities like Rome and Brussels will be hit by snow storms too. It is an alarming situation as it is rare phenomenon in these regions. Scientists are saying that Arctic region must remain cold otherwise this kind of extreme cold situation is bound to happen frequently in future. This kind of weather is technically called Wacky weather and is pretty scary. Scientists have said that the warmth above the Arctic is a direct result of global warming.   It’s high time that governments start taking Global Warming seriously. Global warming is no longer a myth and its effects are being experienced all over the world. 
Extreme winters, extreme summers, high floods, intensified cyclones, etc are all direct results or Global Warming and can make human lives way more difficult. Can you imagine that such extreme weathers tend us to contribute more to global warming? For eg: In such harsh cold conditions, European people will use more natural gas, woods, and electricity to keep warm their surroundings... which ultimately contributes to rising in global warming!

A new species of elephant has been discovered in Africa
A new species of Elephant discovered... 
&quot;There is an elephant in the room and we don&apos;t see it”. This line is a part of lyrics wrote by American Idol Kris Allen in the year 2010. Hardly anyone would have thought that it will make so much sense after this many years. A species of elephant has been discovered which was present in front of us... by researchers at Harvard, the University of Illinois and the University of York in Britain.     
The elephant family has expanded with the discovery of its new species in Africa. This species was present in Africa for many centuries but they passed through the eyes and senses of scientists. As of now, only two species of elephants were known Asian and African) but now three. Let&apos;s see how it happened. A research was going on to study fossils and DNA of extinct as well as present-day elephant species. While studying so, an all-new genetic information was found that concludes with a discovery of all new elephant species. The technique used in the research was groundbreaking because scientists believe that this technique can be used to make similar discoveries in future- immaterial of what animal’s lineage is being investigated. The scientists also believe that this discovery will help in their conservation also.   
Elephants are the most intelligent (non-human) creature on earth. A fact that such a dinosaur-sized species managed to survive supports it. And now one more; by fooling scientists and their ego of knowledge.

Soccer Aid to witness many legendary sports person
Usain Bolt All Set to Play Football 
Star ace Runner Usain Bolt is all set to try his hands, or rather his feet, in football this year. He will be participating in a charity match (Soccer Aid) will be playing alongside many other celebrities. The match will take place at Old Trafford, England on June 10, 2018.     
Usain Bolt is a legendary athlete who has won the highest number of gold medals and titles in different categories of races. He is from Jamaica and has recently retired from the sport. However, he is using his retired life to needy&apos;s advantage. He will be one of the helping hands to raise charity. He will be participating in a Soccer Aid match that is organised by UNICEF. Bolt had earlier expressed his desire to play professional football and it seems that this will be his first step towards that. He already has a huge fan base with him and it won’t be surprising if he can actually become part of a professional football club. He said that he is all set to play and has also planned for a special celebration if his team wins.    
It seems Mr Bolt has started enjoying his retirement. Trying his hands in other sport has been a norm for many retired players and rather than focusing on a slow game like golf. It seems that Mr Bolt knows that he just can’t stop running.

Cui Kai have recently tested a hypersonic jet plane that touched the highest speed of 5000+ mph (MACH 7)
Hypersonic planes developed by China 
Cui Kai along with his team of researchers of Chinese Academy of Sciences have recently tested a hypersonic jet plane in China. The test was carried out in a wind tunnel in which this hypersonic jet touched the highest speed of 5000+ mph and a minimum of 3500+ mph. The research experiment was published in the February 2018 edition of the journal Science China Physics, Mechanics & Astronomy. 
Did you know in a normal flight, it takes at least 14 hours to reach New York from Beijing. And now, how about just two hours! That&apos;s exactly the motive of &apos;I&apos; or hypersonic jet planes developed by researcher Cui Kai working for the Chinese military. Currently, the speed of a hypersonic jet plane varies from MACH 5-7 i.e. 3,800 to 5,370 miles per hour and aim to reach 6000 mph. MACH is the ration of the speed of an object to the speed of sound (around 750+ mph). As of now, the testing is said to be successful as the plane is producing low drag and high lift. Thanks to biplane design. The plane is initially supposed to be developed for military use, however, Cui Kai could be used commercially as well. If that happens, it will be a revolution in commercial air travel. 
This is not all as China is working on a project to develop a hypersonic to travel at a speed of MACH 36. That will make the travel time from China to the USA come down to just 14 minutes!!! In addition, they are also developing a plane that can fly at low earth orbits i.e. 100 km above the ground (normal planes travel at 10-15 km of height). This advancement in hypersonic aircraft will give China an upper edge in the space race against NASA and European Space Agency.

Finally, it can be said with surety that Life is possible on Mars
Can Mars ever host life like Earth does? Maybe yes!!! 
Dirk Schulze-Makuch, a planetary scientist from Washington State University in the United States of America has found something undiscovered of a particular area of land in Chile. He had observed life (microbial communities) at Chile&apos;s Atacama desert- which is very much similar to Mars. The findings were published in February edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
It is widely believed that Mars is the only planet in our solar system that can host life. In past years, frozen water has been found and more importantly, signs of microbial life but completely dead. Atacama Desert&apos;s climate is very similar to Mars. Near to nil traces of water, driest and most arid region on earth, microbial life is dead. However, unlike Mars - which is also colder along with being harshly dry - Atacama do witness very little rainfall, but in gaps of decades and centuries. The Atacama must thank our mother earth! And in 2015, researchers&apos; witnessed some rain- a very rare phenomenon in the Atacama Desert. They came back again in 2016 and in 2017 to collect samples of soil in order to test it. What they found was a surprise. They found microbial community thriving in the soil. How can it be so when the microbial were all dead. Obviously, rain or to say water may have helped. But the fact concluded is that if dead microbial life at Atacama desert can be alive with some rain, same can happen on Mars too! Mars need just some persistent rains and a warmer temperature to host life. 
Can we take gallons of water to Mars to born a life? Maybe... however impossible considering the current space travel and carriage limits. In future, it may be when some huge space object strikes Mars and releases tonnes of CO2 in Martian atmosphere: Global Warming on Mars take place and eventually frozen water flows. We hope our scientist works more on developing a closed channel to transport earth&apos;s CO2 to Mars and create a win-win situation for both the planets: halting Climate Change of Earth and giving birth to our solar cousins.

A teacher in Kumasi, Ghana smartly utilised blackboard to explain &apos;MS Word&apos; to his students
Ghana teacher draw &apos;MS Word&apos; on blackboard for its students
Owura Kwadwo Hottish, a teacher in Kumasi, Ghana smartly utilised blackboard to explain &apos;MS Word&apos; to his students, by drawing the interface on the board. He posted the picture on facebook on 15th February 2018 and is receiving worldwide appreciation for the same. 
Do we find teachers saying that they cannot explain a certain topic due to lack of resources? In most of the cases! That is probably the reason why anybody cannot be a teacher. It takes willpower and out-of-the-comfort-zone efforts to be a teacher like Owura.  Owura Kwadwo Hottish has worked for his students against all odds. He drew the windows of MS Word on the blackboard. He used chalks of all colours in order to make his students understand clearly the features and utility of MS Word. The students too took equal interest and copied the same in the notebooks. He posted the pictures on facebook and mentioned that &apos; have to do what will make them understand&apos;. This clearly shows something more than a passion required to be a true and inspirational teacher. 
A few weeks ago we read about teachers using story strips, puppet shows and drawing to make students study boring subjects and increasing the attendance in the school. Today, it&apos;s another teacher putting in extra efforts for students. If all the world&apos;s teachers become like them, we bet every student will like to study for the lifetime.

The Simpsons&quot; predicted two incidents of Winter Olympics 2018 way back in the first decade of 21st century
Predictions by &quot;The Simpsons&quot; about Winter Olympics came true 
Yes,  &quot;The Simpsons&quot; predicted two incidents of Winter Olympics 2018 (held in South Korea) way back in the first decade of 21st century. One was predicted in Season 8 named &apos;Mountain of Madness&apos; (1997) and the other was predicted in 2010 in the episode named &apos;Boy meets Curl&apos;. 
&apos;The Simpsons&apos; is the longest animated series entertaining us since 1989. Now it seems that Simpson not only entertains but predicts as well. Even the writers might not have known that dialogues and stories written by them will become ever be real. The first prediction it made about a squirrel that came in way of a snowboarding slope and escaping death marginally. The second was about the US winning gold in curling against Sweden. And it exactly happened at Winter Olympics 2018 when a squirrel ran on to slope to Australian Snowboarder Daniela risking athlete&apos;s life. While a situation like this one did not have Olympics in Simpsons, John Usher winning gold in curling was. On recognizing such, the writer Josh Weinstein immediately matched the incidents and tweeted the resemblance. The executive producer Matt Selman tweeted saying, &apos;Occasionally we predict something good, just to mix it up.&apos; People are happy and saying they need to watch it regularly as the program is predicting everything. 
The Simpsons predicted the victory of Donald Trump as the president of U.S.A 16 years prior to the actual elections. Now, the incidents are increasing and people&apos;s expectations. And, sales of the comics too!

Superorganism Band creates music in an unusual way
Everything is not normal in the house 
Do you think that people who perform together on stages as a band are same in their lives? Something similar was broken by the band &apos;Superorganism&apos;. Even after being a band the least they do is feel that they are a band and stay together.  The band is made by international members belonging to Lancashire, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand aged between 17-32 years.
Do you talk to your family members through internet or messages or emails? We are not being something unpopular, actually, that&apos;s the way a band composes their music and songs. No points for guessing - as we are talking about the band Superorganism and its members. Superorganism is an indie pop band. It was formed in early 2017 including Orono Noguchi, alongside Harry, Emily, Tucan, Robert Strange, Ruby, B, and Soul as its members. The stardom and the glitters of their life are only for namesake, in real life their lives - apart from creating music - is monotonous. &apos;Our house is the worst thing&apos;, says Harry Young, one of the members out of eight. Orono Noguchi agrees with Harry. As the band is made of international members, each band member does his artistic/ musical work at his/her own home/country and send the fragments to each other through emails. They couldn&apos;t record together and were pissed off when tried once. In fact, they recorded their first single in a similar way i.e. separately and then clubbed it together. Their first single &quot;Something For Your M.I.N.D.&quot; was composed following the same approach. Did you know that above song was featured on the soundtrack of FIFA 18? Above all, they now own a 24-hr music studio in London. 
Working method is not judged until desired results are achieved. The Superorganism band is creating music with an unusual method by not sitting together. We hope parliament of many countries learns something from here.
